# Data analysis and Visualization scirpts for binary black hole merger in the presence of magnetic fields. 
Visualizations generated from numerical simulations of binary black system in the presence of external magnetic filds using open-source code GiRaFFE( General Relativistic Force Free Electrodynamics) https://ascl.net/1810.012 
Some visualization of electromagnetic Poynting luminosity and struture of magnetic fields can be found here(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZlVYOYiOKK-2zwd-1NonmQ/videos) 
Simulations output 3D data on AMR grid. Visualizations are generated using open-source software VisIt (https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit).
